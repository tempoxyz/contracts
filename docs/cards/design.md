# Design

How a card from any provider pays from funds a cardholder keeps on Tempo, publicly or in a Zone, in
stablecoin or Tempo Earn shares. Every program is a `CardSpender` over one provider engine, its
`ICardProvider`, deployed by a `CardFactory`. The shape follows Tempo Earn: a stable contract users
point at (Earn's `EarnVault`, here the program), over a provider-specific engine (Earn's
`IEarnEngine`, here the provider contract) whose optional behavior is an ERC-165 capability. This page owns the
shared design; [bridge/](bridge/README.md) and [rain/](rain/README.md) own each provider.

| Bridge   | [`BridgeProvider`](../../cards/src/providers/bridge/BridgeProvider.sol) | Through the program's Bridge spender clone and the "TS" handler, into a settlement wallet. |

A program has one address for its life, and cardholders' access keys and the Zone's router name it. It
is never upgraded or migrated: its constructor takes only its provider and the `ZoneRouterFactory` whose
routers may call `spendFrom` (its `CardFactory`'s), and a provider replaces a program by deploying a new one, which means cardholders authorize a new key and the Zone admits a new
router. The program is ownerless, with no setter, no pause of its own and no operator key in the audit
scope.

A program needs no pause of its own. Bridge's spender factory pause stops its programs through
`BridgeProvider.paused()`, which also reads as paused while the factory would not route the clone's "TS"
calls. Rain's contracts have no pause, so Rain has no on-chain stop: it stops a program by revoking its
access keys and Zone keys, the only senders of its spends, which can pay only destinations the provider
authorizes (for Rain, collateral Rain controls). Cardholders can revoke their keys, and a
fix to the core means a new program either way.

## The provider

`ICardProvider` answers three questions on every spend:

- `isAuthorizedDestination(payer, destination, token, hint, isPrivate)`: may this payer's spend of this
  token pay this destination? `hint` is the provider's evidence about the destination, carried in
  `CardSpend.destinationHint`. `isPrivate` comes from the program, true only for `spendFrom`, so a provider
  contract applies "a private spend must not name the cardholder" without inspecting the payer. A private
  spend has no payer: the program passes zero.
- `isAllowedVault(vault)`: may spends redeem this Earn vault's shares? A vault's `withdrawExact` decides
  where redeemed value goes, so allowing one is as strong as adding a destination.
- `paused()`: have the provider's own contracts stopped spends?

The optional `ICardProviderPayout` capability names a `payoutTarget` and the `payoutData` for a spend. When
the provider declares it (ERC-165, read once in the constructor), the program pays by approving the target
for the spend's input and calling it as the payer. Bridge needs this because its factory must govern
every spend through its own clone; a provider without such contracts, like Rain, lets the program pay
directly. Either way the program checks the destination got exactly the amount.

```

- **Public.** The provider sends one L1 transaction from the cardholder's account, signed with an access
  key the cardholder scoped to `token.approve(recipient = program)` and `program.spend`, with a periodic
  limit. It approves the exact amount (and, for Earn, the share quote), spends and clears the approval.
  The provider approves the card on the L1 receipt.
- **Private.** The provider sends one Zone transaction from the cardholder's Zone account, signed with a
  Zone key scoped to the outbox, that withdraws `maxInput` plus change to the router with Spend callback
  data naming the program as spender. The provider approves the card on the Zone receipt; the L1 settles
  about a second later on a local Zone. If settlement reverts, the portal returns the whole withdrawal to
  the Zone and the provider's reserve covers the card.

The withdrawal parameters, fees, change and callback gas follow the Bridge design's
[private spend](bridge/design.md#withdrawal-parameters); the `CardSpend` callback is 896 bytes of the
outbox's 1,024. Bridge's callback gas figures were measured on its payout path. `warm` does nothing
for a program that pays directly (Rain); anyone calls `warmVault(vault)` instead, for a vault the provider
allows, so its first Earn spend does not create the standing approval to that vault (a new allowance slot,
TIP-1000). Anyone may also send a program one unit of each token it handles: `spendFrom` treats what the
program holds as its baseline and leaves it there, so a spend never creates the program's balance slot
(about 250k gas). The Rain E2E requests 3,000,000.

## What the program checks

- `CardSpend.program` is this program (`WrongProgram`); `amount` is above zero and `fromVault` at most
  `amount` (`InvalidAmount`).
- A program that pays directly asks its provider: it has not paused the program (`ProgramPaused`), it
  authorizes the destination for this payer, token and path (`DestinationNotAuthorized`), and an Earn
  spend's vault is allowed and holds `token` (`VaultNotAllowed`, `IncorrectAssetForVault`). A program
  that pays through a payout target leaves those rules to the target, which enforces them in the same call
  (`ICardProviderPayout`); asking the provider first would only repeat them. Either way a spend burns at
  most `maxShares` (`ShareCostExceeded`; zero accepts the live price).
- The destination's balance of `token` rises by exactly `amount` (`DestinationNotCredited`).
- A virtual destination (TIP-1022) is credited through its master, so the program checks the master's
  balance, and redeems Earn shares for one to itself first and transfers them on, since Earn's engines
  check the literal receiver.
- `spendFrom`: the caller is a router the program's `ROUTER_FACTORY` deployed whose mode lists the program
  (`NotRouter`), so `maxInput` is what a router measured and sent; the input is the stablecoin, or the
  vault's EarnShare when Earn funds all of it (`WrongInputToken`); the program holds at least `maxInput`
  (`InsufficientInput`) and spends from no more than it; the spend consumes some input (`NothingSpent`);
  the unused input goes back to the caller and the program ends at its baseline (`ResidualBalance`). On
  the direct path the vault prices the shares, capped by the lower of `maxInput` and `maxShares`.
- A payout through the provider's target uses exactly the stablecoin part, and for a private Earn spend
  exactly the shares the vault burned, the drop in the EarnShare's supply after the program accrues the vault's fees (`InputNotConsumed`), so a
  replaced target cannot keep any of the input. A public Earn spend can use at most the share cost the
  program quoted to pull. Anything beyond the spend's input reverts.
- A transient lock stops reentry. Standing approvals (to an allowed vault, or to the payout target) are
  harmless because the program holds at most a one-unit seed between spends.
- Events: `CardSpent(ref, payer, destination, token, amount, fromVault, sharesUsed, isPrivate)`, and for a
  private spend `InputSpent(ref, inputToken, inputConsumed, inputReturned)`. A private spend's payer is
  the router, so neither names a cardholder or the Zone `senderTag`.

## Invariants

1. A spend pays only a destination its provider authorizes for that payer, token and path, and none while
   the program is paused.
2. The destination gets exactly `amount`.
3. A spend from Earn burns no more than `maxShares` when set; unused shares go back to the payer.
4. The program and the router hold no input after a spend; the program keeps any seed it held before.
5. A private spend uses at most `maxInput`, which the cardholder's Zone transaction sets, and only a
   router the program's router factory deployed and lists it in may call `spendFrom`; a payout target
   uses exactly the stablecoin and at most the quoted share cost.
6. No event from these contracts on the private path names the cardholder or the Zone `senderTag`.
7. One program's spend never pays through another program.
8. A program's provider never changes; its address commits to it and the program ID.

Tests: [`cards/test/core/`](../../cards/test/core/) runs every program behavior twice, paying directly and
through a payout target, with mock provider contracts and no real provider; each provider's tests run its provider contract on a
real program ([bridge](bridge/harness.md), [rain](rain/README.md#evidence)), and
[`e2e/cards`](../../e2e/cards/) runs both on a real L1 and Zone.

## Privacy

"Private" means the L1 settlement does not name the cardholder: the payer is the router, the destination
is one the program shares across cardholders, and the change returns as an encrypted deposit. The Zone's
sequencer sees the cardholder's withdrawal, and the L1 shows each spend's amount, token, destination and
time. A provider contract that authorized a cardholder-specific destination when `isPrivate` is true would break
this, so providers authorize only pooled destinations for a private spend (Rain:
[destinations](rain/README.md#destinations)). `BridgeProvider` answers alike for both paths, so Bridge
governance must authorize only settlement wallets every cardholder shares. A spend's `ref` is public on
the L1: a provider uses a reference that cannot be linked to the cardholder for a private spend, such as
`keccak256(pullId, programSecret)` with a secret of its own per program.

### Reconciliation

Spend events are not proof of payment, and `ref` is advisory: it comes from callback data anyone can
write. A provider reconciles a spend by its transaction and log index, and binds a private spend's
`CardSpent` and `InputSpent` to the Portal's `WithdrawalProcessed` and the router's `Spent` in the same
transaction, a public one to its own access key's transaction. `availableBalance` is an upper bound on what
one spend can pay: it values shares with `previewRedeem`, while a spend pays at the `previewWithdraw`
cost, which rounds against the payer, and a private spend carries one token, so it never mixes the
stablecoin and shares.

## Accepted risks

The Bridge design's [accepted risks](bridge/design.md#accepted-risks) carry over: a leaked Zone key can
withdraw a cardholder's Zone balance outside the program; there is no on-chain idempotency, so the
provider dedupes spends off chain; the provider approves a private spend on the Zone receipt and its
reserve pays if settlement fails; spend events are not proof of payment. In addition:

- A provider contract is as strong as what it reads. It decides every destination, so a provider whose own
  contracts can be upgraded (Rain's factory, Bridge's spender factory) is trusted for that, and a payout
  target is trusted to pay the spend it is handed (the program bounds what it can take).
- Programs are immutable and have no pause of their own. Changing a program's provider contract, its
  tokens or vaults means deploying a new program and a router that lists it, and cardholders authorizing
  a new key. Meanwhile the provider's own pause, read through the provider contract, stops spends where
  it has one (Bridge's spender factory), and a private spend while paused bounces back into the Zone in
  full; a provider without one (Rain) stops spends by revoking the keys that send them.
- Only routers can call `spendFrom`: one the program's `ROUTER_FACTORY` deployed whose mode lists the
  program. Tokens sent to a program outside a spend stay there as part of its baseline, which no spend
  touches and nothing recovers; a one-unit seed per token is the only balance a program is meant to hold.
- A provider whose destination check ignores `isPrivate` (Bridge) relies on its governance to authorize
  only destinations every cardholder shares.

## Adding a provider

1. Vendor the provider's contracts unmodified under `cards/vendor/<provider>/` and record their provenance
   in [VENDORED.md](../../cards/vendor/VENDORED.md).
2. Write its `ICardProvider` in `cards/src/providers/<provider>/`, reading the provider's contracts as they
   are. Authorize only pooled destinations when `isPrivate` is true. Implement `ICardProviderPayout` only if
   the provider's own contracts must move the funds.
3. Deploy a program with `CardFactory.deploy(programId, provider)`, on the `CardFactory` for the
   `ZoneRouterFactory` whose routers may call it, and a Spend-mode router from that factory that lists it.
4. Add a provider to [`e2e/cards/src/providers/`](../../e2e/cards/src/providers/) implementing
   [`CardProvider`](../../e2e/cards/src/provider.ts): deploy, the three destinations, and its own
   settlement.
